# Pangenome_building

This handy pipeline is a reference-based pangenome building pipeline, which developed based on the publication of "The pangenome of an agronomically important crop plant Brassica oleracea". It will be expected to be used to construct the pangenome and explore the genetic variations in the plant/crop species.
